AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH

This is a mini-project to clone the Google homepage and get some hands-on experience practicing HTML and CSS. 

A few skills I've gained during this mini-project:
1. Creating classes in CSS and linking them to HTML divs
2. Utilizing position: relative and position: absolute. 

Note for self: position: relative places an element relative to its current position without changing the layout around it. position: absolute places an element relative to its parent's position and changing the layout around it. position: static is the default and top, right, bottom, left, z-index properties do not apply.

3. Difference between :active, :focus, and :hover
4. Using display: flex, justify-content, flex-direction, and align-items/align-content
5. Various properties of elements such as border-radius, border, background-color, box-shadow, etc.
6. Creating and styling buttons and input fields

This project was quite frustrating for me at first, but once I understood a little more about the structure of divs and containers, it made it a tad bit easier. I still have a lot to learn on my journey, but I'm proud of the way my page looks!
